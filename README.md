## About

The MERN Notes App is a dynamic web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to provide seamless note-taking functionality. Leveraging MongoDB as its database, the app enables users to efficiently create, retrieve, update, and delete notes. The combination of these technologies ensures a smooth and responsive user experience for efficient organization and management of personal notes.
